                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    This Accident Severity Prediction System is designed to predict the severity of road accidents
                    based on various factors such as driver characteristics, vehicle type, road conditions, and
                    environmental factors. The system uses machine learning to analyze historical accident data
                    and provide predictions about potential accident severity.
                </p>
